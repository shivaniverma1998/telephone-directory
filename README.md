# Getting Started with Create React App




Telephone Directory
Welcome to the Telephone Directory project! This is a simple web application designed to function as a basic phone book. It allows users to enter and manage contact information including first names, last names, and phone numbers. The application provides a straightforward and user-friendly interface for managing contacts, and it automatically sorts them by last name.

Features
Form for Adding Contacts: Easily input first name, last name, and phone number into a form.
Dynamic List: The contact list updates automatically with each new entry.
Automatic Sorting: Contacts are sorted alphabetically by last name.
Pre-populated Form: The form is pre-filled with default values upon loading.
Attractive Design: Modern and responsive UI with gradient colors and a background image for the form.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v14 or later)
npm (comes with Node.js)
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/shivaniverma1998/telephone-directory.git
Navigate to the Project Directory

bash
Copy code
cd telephone-directory
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
npm install
Start the Development Server

bash
Copy code
npm start
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Usage

Inspired by basic phone book applications and UI design principles.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
